# Alerts

An alert is a box that pops up to give the user a message.

Ex:alert("Are You Sure??");

# Variables for Strings 

Variable is a word that refers to a particular value.

A variable is created when you write var (for variable) followed by the name.

Ex:
1.var name = "Mark";

2.var nationality;

  nationality = "U.S.";
  
3.var thanx = "Thanks for your input!"

  alert(thanx);

# Variables for Numbers:

A string isn't the only thing you can assign to a variable. You can also assign a number.

Ex:
1.var weight = 150;
2.var originalNum = 23;
  var newNum = originalNum + 7;
3.var originalNum = "23";
  var newNum = originalNum + 7;
 -JavaScript can't sum a string and a number. JavaScript interprets
  "23" as a word, not a number.

# Variable Names Legal and Illegal:

-A variable name can't contain any spaces.

-A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.

-Variable names are case sensitive.

-Adopt the camelCase convention. It'll make your variable names more readable, and you'll be less likely to get variable names mixed up.

-Make your variable names descriptive.
